RSV Tiled Amplicon Sequencing 
--

A protocol for RSV-A and RSV-B sequencing that consists of two pools of overlapping amplicons. The amplicons are ~400bp long and are compatible with Illumina and Nanopore sequencing. Its designed to work with current Artic SARS-CoV-2 protocols. 

### RSV-A
- Uses hRSV/A/England/397/2017 (EPI_ISL_412866) as the reference, which is available on GISAID
- Consists of 51 primer pairs.
- primer pair 51 has alternative forward primers.

### RSV-B
- Uses hRSV/B/Australia/VIC-RCH056/2019 (EPI_ISL_1653999) as the reference, which ia available on GISAID
- consists of 50 primer pairs, with all odd numbered pairs in pool 1 and even numbered primers in pool 2
